Today I was invited to give a talk by [McMaster ReproducibiliTea](https://reproducibilitea.org/journal-clubs/#McMaster). [ReproducibiliTea](https://reproducibilitea.org/) is a "grassroots journal club initiative that helps researchers create local Open Science journal clubs at their universities," and it has university chapters all over the world.

For this talk I decided to update a talk that I gave in Spain this past summer, and talk about Open Science for All. The key themes of the talk are as follows:

- Science has been incredibly effective way to unveil the mysteries of the universe.
- It has been successful because it has historically been an open, collective enterprise.
- However, science has become increasingly closed, for reasons that include the cost of entry and the emergence of perverse incentives that prioritize quantity over quality.
- Science should be "open" by definition. The fact that we are talking about _open_ science is indicative of this closing.
- Science becomes less effective when the public feels alienated from it, when it is seen as a luxurious hobby for few.
- If we aspire to see science remain as an effective, positive part of civilization we need to reclaim the spirit of openness of science.
- In fact, recasting science as a _public good_, that belongs to all, and from all benefit.
- There are several initiatives that aim to re-open science at every level, from individual researchers, to communities of practice, to various levels of government and international organizations.
- There are reasons to be positive, but much work remains to be done, and it is something in which all, artists, humanists, philosophers, as well as scientists should have a stake in.
