Welcome to [Inktober](https://inktober.com/)!  
  
Inktober is an annual challenge: 31 days and 31 drawings. It is a great opportunity to be creating, to learn something new, to improve your drawing skills. It can be a lot of things, and it is to a lot of people: since it was created in 2009 by [Jake Parker](https://www.mrjakeparker.com/) it has grown into an international event with thousands upon thousands of participants.  
 
This year I am too busy to create something new, but I will take the opportunity to learn something new: blogging. And I will repost my Inktober drawings of 2016 that I had not made public before. Hope you will enjoy!
