    "text": "Welcome to Inktober!\nInktober is an annual challenge: 31 days and 31 drawings. It is a great opportunity to be creating, to learn something new, to improve your drawing skills. It can be a lot of things, and it is to a lot of people: since it was created in 2009 by Jake Parker it has grown into an international event with thousands upon thousands of participants.\nThis year I am too busy to create something new, but I will take the opportunity to learn something new: blogging. And I will repost my Inktober drawings of 2016 that I had not made public before. Hope you will enjoy!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today I was invited to give a talk by McMaster ReproducibiliTea. ReproducibiliTea is a “grassroots journal club initiative that helps researchers create local Open Science journal clubs at their universities,” and it has university chapters all over the world.\n\nFor this talk I decided to update a talk that I gave in Spain this past summer, and talk about Open Science for All. The key themes of the talk are as follows:\n\nScience has been incredibly effective way to unveil the mysteries of the universe.\nIt has been successful because it has historically been an open, collective enterprise.\nHowever, science has become increasingly closed, for reasons that include the cost of entry and the emergence of perverse incentives that prioritize quantity over quality.\nScience should be “open” by definition. The fact that we are talking about open science is indicative of this closing.\nScience becomes less effective when the public feels alienated from it, when it is seen as a luxurious hobby for few.\nIf we aspire to see science remain as an effective, positive part of civilization we need to reclaim the spirit of openness of science.\nIn fact, recasting science as a public good, that belongs to all, and from all benefit.\nThere are several initiatives that aim to re-open science at every level, from individual researchers, to communities of practice, to various levels of government and international organizations.\nThere are reasons to be positive, but much work remains to be done, and it is something in which all, artists, humanists, philosophers, as well as scientists should have a stake in.\n\nThe slides of the talk are below."
